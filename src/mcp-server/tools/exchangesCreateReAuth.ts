Create a new re-authentication exchange session.

Request body requirements vary by exchange type:
- For Visa: Request body with redirect URL is required
- For Plaid Web: No request body is required
- For Plaid Mobile: Request body with redirect URL is required

The redirect URL will be validated against previously configured URLs stored in Dwolla.
After completing the re-authorization process, the user will be redirected back to your application using this URL.
