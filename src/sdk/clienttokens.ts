   * Create a client token

   * Create a client token for secure authentication within Dwolla Drop-in components. Requires a granular permission action and a Customer link to define what operations the end user can perform within the component. Returns a short-lived token for configuring client-side Drop-in components including customer creation, verification, funding source management, and payment processing. Essential for implementing secure, embeddable UI components without exposing application credentials to the frontend.
