# Security Policy

## Development Status

This repository is currently in active development and has not yet undergone a formal security
review. The code is not yet production-ready and should be used with caution.

## Security Considerations

- This is a pre-release version of the SDK
- No formal security audit has been performed
- The code may contain security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes may be introduced without notice
- Features may be incomplete or unstable

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Email developers@dwolla.com with the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

## Best Practices

Until a formal security review is completed, we recommend:

1. Using this SDK only in development/testing environments
2. Not storing sensitive credentials in the code
3. Implementing proper error handling
4. Following security best practices for API key management
5. Regularly updating to the latest version as security fixes are implemented

## Updates

This security policy will be updated as the project progresses through security reviews and becomes
production-ready.
