# AccountNameInquiry

The result of comparing the expected cardholder name supplied on the exchange session
against the name the card issuer has on file.
- `full-match`: the expected name matched the name on file.
- `partial-match`: part of the expected name matched, for example the last name only.
- `no-match`: the expected name did not match the name on file.
- `not-performed`: ANI was not requested, or the check did not run.
- `not-supported`: the card issuer or network does not support ANI.

import { AccountNameInquiry } from "dwolla/models";

let value: AccountNameInquiry = "full-match";
